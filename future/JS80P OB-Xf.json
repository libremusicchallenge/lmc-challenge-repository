If you are a Mac user however you will not be let down as the wonderful OB-Xf, https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/OB-Xf, is also allowed.  Your challenge for this round is to **make a track using the JS80P and/or the OB-Xf**.  You can use as many instances of the JS80P or the OB-Xf as you like, with any effect, any sampler and any DAW as long as they are 𝐟𝐫𝐞𝐞 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐨𝐩𝐞𝐧 𝐬𝐨𝐮𝐫𝐜𝐞.
