  "long_description": "You like shallow and aggresive music that hits your soul like a hammer?  Look away then because this round is not for you.  Your challenge for this round is to **make an ambient track**.  What is an ambient track, you may ask?  I may answer, I do not know.  But I know great artists like Massergy, State Azure and Carbon Based Lifeforms that make ambient tracks.  Do as good as them, and win, simple.  You can use any plugin and any DAW as long as they are **free and open source**.  You can use any sample as long as they properly licensed (be responsible).  You are also allowed to record instrumental or vocal performances.  Now go medidate then make an epic ambient track.  *Happy music making!*",
