  "long_description": "In 1987 a very special piece of software was released for the Commodore Amiga, 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐔𝐥𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐒𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐝𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐤𝐞𝐫 by Karsten Obarski.  It came with a sample disk, called 𝐒𝐓-𝟎𝟏, containing 126 samples that Karsten Obarski created himself by sampling his own synthesizers like the Roland D-50, the Yamaha DX21, the Casio CZ-101 and the Roland Juno-106.  Your challenge for this round is to 𝐦𝐚𝐤𝐞 𝐚 𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐤 𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐨𝐧𝐥𝐲 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐬𝐞 𝐬𝐚𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞𝐬.  The samples can be downloaded from the 𝐒𝐓𝐄𝐌𝐒 & 𝐃𝐎𝐖𝐍𝐋𝐎𝐀𝐃 menu of the challenge track.  You can use any sampler (but let me make a special mention of the Ami Sampler from astriiddev), any effect and any DAW as long as they are 𝐟𝐫𝐞𝐞 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐨𝐩𝐞𝐧 𝐬𝐨𝐮𝐫𝐜𝐞.  Samples can be edited within reason, to enable smooth looping and such.  However no external audio source such as guitar or singing is allowed for this round.  Ideally you would attempt to make a song that is in the spirit of the music that was produced on the Amiga at the time.  𝐻𝑎𝑝𝑝𝑦 𝑚𝑢𝑠𝑖𝑐 𝑚𝑎𝑘𝑖𝑛𝑔!",
