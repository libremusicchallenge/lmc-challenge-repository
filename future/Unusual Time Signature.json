  "long_description": "Are you tired of the usual 4/4, 12/8 or even 9/8 time signature?  If the answer is yes then you are in luck, because the challenge for this round is to **make a track with an unusual time signature**.  What is an unusual time signature?  I suppose one could say that it is any time signature with a **numerator that is a prime number greater than 3**.  By that definition unusual time signatures would include for example 5/4, 7/8, 11/8, et cetera.  You can use any plugin, any effect and any DAW as long as they are **free and open source**.  You can also record live performances and use any properly licensed sample.  Still want an unusual challenge?  Now is a prime time to sign!  *Happy music making!*",
