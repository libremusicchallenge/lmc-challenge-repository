  "long_description": "Let us go back to the root, from where it all started, live instrumentation!  Your challenge for this round is to **make a track with at least one live instrumentation in it**.  It could be accoustic, electronic, or even digital if anything else, but it has to be live performed.  You can use any plugin, any effect and any DAW as long as they are **free and open source**.  Additionally you can use any sample as long as they are properly licensed (be responsible).  Now go jam and make an epic live performance (and do not forget to press record).  *Happy music making!*",
