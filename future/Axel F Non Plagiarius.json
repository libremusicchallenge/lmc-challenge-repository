Your challenge for this round is to **make a track in the style of the Beverly Hills Cop main theme**.  You are not allowed to make a cover nor, God forbids, a plagiarius.  The track must be an original but must be in the style of Axel F.  You can use any synth, any effect and any DAW as long as they are **free and open source**.  You are not allowed to record audio performance like guitar or vocal, everything must be MIDI sequenced or controlled.  *Happy Music Making!*",
