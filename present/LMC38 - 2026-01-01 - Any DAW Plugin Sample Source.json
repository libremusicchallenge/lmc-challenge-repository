  "short_description": "The challenge for this round is to make a track with any (FOSS) DAW, any (FOSS) plugin, any sample and any audio source.",
  "long_description": "After a year long hiatus we are restarting the LMC with epic freedom.  Your challenge for this round is to make a track using any DAW and plugin you like as long as they are 𝐟𝐫𝐞𝐞 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐨𝐩𝐞𝐧 𝐬𝐨𝐮𝐫𝐜𝐞.  Additionally you can use any properly licensed sample (be responsible) and you can even record any audio track from any source you like (vocal, acoustic, electric, digital, anything you like).  Enjoy your freedom because most future rounds will be more constrained than this one.  More generic information, including about submission and voting, are provided below.  Oh, I almost forgot, there is a modest prize of 50 AUDIO tokens to the winner!  I know it is not much but this will hopefully grow in the future.  𝐻𝑎𝑝𝑝𝑦 𝑚𝑢𝑠𝑖𝑐 𝑚𝑎𝑘𝑖𝑛𝑔!",
